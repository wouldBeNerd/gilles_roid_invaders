Gilles roid invaders is an attempt at a browserbased none canvas game.
Is is primarily based on the classic Space Invaders Game. 
Created in coorporation with Gilles Van Raemdonck.

[demo the game](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/wouldBeNerd/gilles_roid_invaders/blob/master/index.html) it currently needs a big resultion to play. Try zooming out your browser if the invader roids descend too fast. 

hint: killing the boss grants the player who hits it a special treat
